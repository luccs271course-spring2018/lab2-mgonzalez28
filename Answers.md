 <h1>What is the complexity of each of the four search methods in terms of array or list size n?
  
    *Comlexity of findTeamposition (array) = O(n) 
    *Complexity of findTeamPosition (list) = O(n) 
    *Complexity of findTeamMinFunding (array) = O(n) 
    *Complexoty of findTeamMinFundingFast = O(log(n))
  
 <h1>What happens in the case of binary search if the array is not sorted?
 
    *If the array is not sorted, the target item might not be found, as the binary search could search the incorrect half based on the values to left and right of the middle value. If the value to the right is less than the middle, then the binary search would search the values to the right, assuming the target item is less than the middle, but it's possible that the target item is not in this half. If the value to the left is greater than the middle, the binary search would search the values to the left, assuming the target item is greater than the middle, but again, its possible that the target item is not in this half.
